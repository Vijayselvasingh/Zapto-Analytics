# Problem statement
To create a dashboard in Tableau that showcases the demand level in each fulfillment center and provides a granular understanding of the performance of the center by including sales information. The client wants an end-to-end report to identify which fulfillment areas are performing well and which ones are not, and to add nuance to the report, the analysis should also consider the center-meal combination. The objective is to provide the client with a comprehensive understanding of the demand level in each fulfillment center and its relation to the product offerings.
# Approach
Crafted interactive dashboard on 450k+ rows dataset across 15 fields using Tableau Desktop.
# Outcome
Delivered a comprehensive and interactive Tableau report that illustrates the demand level in each fulfillment center, offering a granular analysis of center performance through product information and center-meal combination insights. The report will empower informed decision-making by revealing strengths and weaknesses.
